# Cool Rock Paper Scissors 👊✋✌️  
## A Rock  Paper Scissors web-app built with streamlit  

[Model used on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/alexandredj/rockpaperscissorscnn)


The app provides a preview of your webcam, allows you to take a picture of your move and tries to guess what you picked.  
Then, it makes a random pick and selects the winner.  
After the round is done, you can view the overall stats for all your rounds within the session and mark your guessed pick as incorrect, which excludes the current round from the stats.
